# ScientificCPP
##Motivation for this project.
This is a repo dedicated to apply most of the Computational methods. Yep it has been inspired from MATLAB, but thing is MATLAB is too slow, hence trying to implement some faster algorihms.

##Log of the work done.
> 21-11-2015: Created the first file which would include all the include files, and hence including this file would therefore ensure the inclusion of all other files.
> 23-11-2015: Made the basic functions for Arrays, namely: ones, zeroes & display. Each one would do their functions as their names say.

## Various Functions Involved.
> Essesntials/zero.cpp: This contains a function void zeroes(std::vector<double> &), takes the input as an argument and make all its contents equal to zero.
> Essesntials/one.cpp: This contains a function void ones(std::vector<double> &), takes the input as an argument and make all its contents equal to one.
> Essentials/ArrayDisplay.cpp: This contains a function void display(std::vector<double> &), Takes input the current vector and displays it into the terminal. 

##IDEAS/ Work in Pipeline.
> The Essestials/ArrayDisplay.cpp :: void display(std::vector<double> &) should have more overloaded functions like "display('c',_VECTOR_NAME_) should give the display of the vector preceded by the counter."
