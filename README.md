##Motivation for this project.
This is a repo dedicated to apply most of the Computational methods. Yep it has been inspired from MATLAB, but thing is MATLAB is too slow, hence trying to implement some faster algorihms.

##Log of the work done.
>21-11-2015: Created the first file which would include all the include files, and hence including this file would therefore ensure the inclusion of all other files.
