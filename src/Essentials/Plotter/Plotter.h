/**
 * VARIABLES USED:
 * std::vector<double> GivenVector: This actually is used as a function argument and has no end use. It is the part of the function void zeroes(vector<double> & )
 * int CurrentElement: This denotes the CurrentElement we are dealing in the vector we are dealling with.
 * int VecorLength: This denotes the length of the vector being dealt over here.

 * FUNCTIONS USED/CREATED:
 * void ones(vector<double> & ): This is the main operating function of this file.
